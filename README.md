I used java because it was easier for me to read from excel files using libraries apache poi. Firstly, I read in all the information from a file. I calculated how many times did a customer buy something at the shop. Items that were bought at the same time have the same check id but different ids. As a result, it was chosen to consider it as one transaction. However, each item was added to calculate the total amount of items bought by this customer/or returned back to the shop. Additionally, I calculated the price that was spent every customer (*amount of items). Eventually, there were 3 diffent variables 1. amount of times customer visited the shop, 2. number of items bought by a customer, 3. overall price that a customer paid. Based on that I decided to use K-means clustering algorithm to classify a customer to one of 3 groups: active, not active and medium. Additionally the data was normallized The graph ![alt text](https://github.com/salta312/ml1/blob/master/scr.png)
